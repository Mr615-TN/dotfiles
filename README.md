This repo is used to track my configurations in Linux and MacOS.

The tools are mostly the same with some minor differences whether it is macOS or Linux.

The neovim, helix, and oh my posh configurations are the same across the board, but for things like ghostty and fastfetch, there are some minor differences.

For Linux, I went back to PikaOS which is based on Debian SID (debian unstable) and I am using their hyprland configuration. I made my own hyprland config, but I will test that later on
